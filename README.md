Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray
This project aims to detect pneumonia in patients using chest X-ray images. The model is built with deep learning techniques to classify whether the image is normal or shows signs of pneumonia.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an AI model capable of detecting pneumonia in X-ray images. The model can take a chest X-ray image as input and classify it as either:

Normal

Pneumonia

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) available on Kaggle. It contains over 5,000 chest X-ray images, with labels for normal and pneumonia cases. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Model Architecture
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. It is built with multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Key Layers:
Conv2D Layers: For feature extraction

MaxPooling2D Layers: To down-sample the image and retain important features

Dropout: To prevent overfitting

Dense Layers: To make the final classification decision

Softmax Activation: To output probabilities for each class (Normal, Pneumonia)

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Training the Model
To train the model on the dataset, run the following script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
2. Prediction
To make predictions on new chest X-ray images, use the following script:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
This will output whether the image is classified as Normal or Pneumonia.

Example Usage
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image ./test_image.jpg
The model will return either:

Normal

Pneumonia

Results
The model achieves X% accuracy on the test set, which can be improved further with more data or model fine-tuning.

Future Improvements
Collect more data to improve accuracy.

Experiment with different architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, etc.

Implement a web-based application to upload X-ray images for prediction.
